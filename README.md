This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for Feeble, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Tech Used:
- NextJS (The full functionalities of NextJS were not particularly employed)
  - NextJs Localfont
- TailwindCSS
- CSS Transforms

### Implementation Notes:
- The Website is best viewed in full-screen mode on a 1920 × 1080 viewport
- To keep the scope of the project short and simple, the website has been, in effect, set to `no-scroll` with the styles: `w-screen` and `h-screen`.
